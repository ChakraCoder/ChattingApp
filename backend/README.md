# ChattingApp Backend

Welcome to the **ChattingApp Backend**! This is the backend service that powers the **ChattingApp**. It is designed to handle user authentication, real-time messaging, and data storage for chat messages, built with **TypeScript** and **Node.js**. The backend is designed to be scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain, ensuring that users can enjoy smooth communication through the app.

## About

The ChattingApp backend provides the core infrastructure for managing users, handling messaging between them, and ensuring data persistence through a database like MongoDB. It supports features such as user login and sign-up, JWT token authentication, real-time chat capabilities using WebSockets, and profile management. The project uses modern web technologies and follows best practices to ensure reliability and maintainability.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14 or later (Recommended: LTS version)
- **npm**: Node package manager (comes with Node.js)
- **MongoDB**: For persistent data storage (or use a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas)
